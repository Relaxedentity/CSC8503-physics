Execution method
I have used Visual studio for the development of this project. The executable can be run as is.
The executable can be found in the x64 folder. Controls implemented are the basic WASD controls.

Here is a Youtube link to a reel of the project.

This project consists of a combination of my professors framework accompanied by methods and classes defined by a 
combination of both of us. The task for the assignment involved implementing certain game mechanics and features 
into the empty project which I have also placed in my repository described as such. This was done to allow an 
understanding into my contribution to completion of the project. The project was coded alongside my professors
provided study material.

Regarding the areas I struggled with in particular for this project, I had a hard time with the networking and 
AI components. This was the first time I had gotten this hands on with networking and it took me a while to
understand the concepts behind it. In the end, the networking component of this assignment worked to an extent, 
but was nowhere near as refined as I would hope. I was familiar with AI usage within Unity, but had never worked on 
C++ AI movement, though I found it interesting and quite fulfilling after getting the hang of it. 

I would like the projects focus to be the usage of constraints on objects(wobbly bridge) as well as the AI for both the 
duck and zookeeper, as these components took me a large amount of time and effort to develop and hope that that effort
reflects itself in the final product. I struggled with the physics calculations of the constraints for quite
a while before achieving enough of an understanding to succesfully implement it.
